I have historically disliked tailwind a lot and I don't really know how to write it, but AI is really good at it and I think there could be an argument that it's more efficient for me to use tailwind because their opinionated way will result in better experiences for users. The other part is that I don't like that I don't quite understand how it works or that it adds a build step or dependency. I also have this feeling recently that I like that tailwind makes it stupid easy to make good enough UIs that are unique and solves things consistantly to the point where I have this vision that people could essentially make the web their own \"Myspace\" like personalized experience where raw semantics (conveyed via something like markdown and yml frontmatter) that can just be loaded into people's own UIs. Also could you make some of the goals less specific and we can talk about what that could look like? ",

It is the first technology that can adapt computing to the human instead of the other way around. I see LLM's greatest potential for human florishing is when it is acting as the translation layer between human intention and capabilities available via computing. I'm an accessibility expert and I'm obsessed with semantics and translations of information across modalities. I would like this project to be minimal, accessible, and content is written in markdown. I would like it to have light/dark mode. I would like a good developer experience, do I need react for the great AI understanding and eco system or is there a way to get components and good dev ex with good AI support/understanding? I would love for conversation about this project so we can at least get a README.md and a MVP.md that outlines the core architecture and philosophy. ",
