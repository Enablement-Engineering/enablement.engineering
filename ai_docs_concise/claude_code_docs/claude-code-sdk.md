# Claude Code SDK (Concise)

The Claude Code SDK enables programmatic, non-interactive use of Claude Code for building AI-powered coding tools and automation.

**Core Concepts:**
- Run Claude Code as a subprocess from CLI, TypeScript, or Python.
- Supports Anthropic API key, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI authentication.
- Allows multi-turn conversations, custom system prompts, and tool/permission configuration.
- Integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external tools.

**Key Usage:**
- Run prompts, manage sessions, and parse output in text or JSON.
- Control tool permissions, output format, and model selection via flags/options.

**Signal:**
The SDK is the bridge for integrating Claude Code into custom workflows, CI/CD, and automation, enabling agentic coding beyond the interactive REPL.
