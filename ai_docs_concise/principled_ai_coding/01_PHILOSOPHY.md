### AI Coding Philosophy (Concise)

**Core Signal:**
- The engineer's role shifts from manual coding to orchestrating AI agents via clear plans and system thinking.
- Focus on specifying "what" to achieve, not "how" to implement.
- Success depends on balancing context, model, and prompt.
- Start simple (KISS), iterate, then optimize.
- Human-in-the-loop is essential for quality and judgment.
- Build "living software"—automated, self-correcting, and agentic.
- Terminal is the apex of control; leverage parallelism and observability.
- Closed-loop systems (generate → execute → evaluate → feedback) are the foundation of agentic workflows.
