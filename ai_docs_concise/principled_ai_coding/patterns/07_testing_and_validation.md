### Testing & Validation for Agentic Systems (Concise)

**Expanded Testing:**
- Test not just code, but also prompts/specs and agent plans/behavior

**Patterns:**
- Spec Linting/Review: Ensure specs are clear, complete, and actionable
- Plan Validation: Have the agent summarize its plan before execution
- Director Pattern: Use a test suite as the "done" condition in a closed loop
- Prompt Testing: Create unit tests for reusable prompts/workflows

**Signal:**
Testing in agentic systems covers instructions, plans, and outputs, ensuring reliability and correctness at every stage.
