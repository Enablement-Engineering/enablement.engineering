### Parallel Development with Git Worktrees (Concise)

**Why Parallelism:**
- Explore multiple solutions, hedge against agent failure, and compare/merge the best outcomes

**Enabler:**
- Git worktrees provide isolated directories/branches for each agent

**Workflow:**
1. Write a detailed spec (single source of truth)
2. Create parallel worktrees/branches
3. Dispatch agents to implement the spec in each worktree
4. Review, compare, and merge the best solution(s)

**Signal:**
Parallel agentic workflows maximize solution space exploration and reliability in AI-driven development.
