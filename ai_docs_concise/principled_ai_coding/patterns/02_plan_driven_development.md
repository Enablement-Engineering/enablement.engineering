### Plan-Driven Development (Concise)

**Why Plan First:**
- Detailed plans reduce ambiguity, improve reliability, and create reviewable artifacts (spec.md)

**Three-Step Workflow:**
1. Plan with the agent (read-only, explore, discuss, outline)
2. Write/refine the plan in a spec file (versioned, reviewable)
3. Execute the plan—agent implements autonomously from the spec

**Signal:**
Plan-driven development is the foundation of reliable, scalable agentic engineering.
