### Team Collaboration in Agentic Development (Concise)

**Core Practices:**
- Version control `.claude/` config for team consistency and onboarding
- Review and refine specs (plans) as the primary PR artifact before code is generated
- Create a team prompting guide (IDKs, prompt structure, good/bad examples)
- Build a shared library of agentic workflows (slash commands)

**Signal:**
Collaboration in agentic development centers on shared context, reviewable plans, and reusable workflows, making onboarding and teamwork efficient and consistent.
