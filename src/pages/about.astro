    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      I'm Dylan Isaac, an accessibility expert exploring how AI can serve as the translation 
      layer between human intention and computational capability.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>
      For decades, we've forced humans to adapt to computing — learning programming languages, 
      memorizing keyboard shortcuts, navigating complex interfaces. AI represents the first 
      technology capable of reversing this relationship.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Large Language Models aren't just chatbots or coding assistants. They're semantic 
      translators that can bridge the gap between what people want to accomplish and what 
      computers can do. This is the enablement layer we've been missing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
    <p>
      My background in accessibility has taught me that true innovation happens at the edges. 
      When we design for those who are excluded, we create better experiences for everyone. 
      AI as a translation layer isn't just about convenience — it's about fundamental access 
      to computational power.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Experiment</h2>
    <p>
      This blog is both platform and product. Built with AI assistance, it explores:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How AI changes the relationship between intention and implementation</li>
      <li>The tension between understanding and productivity</li>
      <li>What "accessible computing" really means in an AI-enabled world</li>
      <li>The philosophical implications of technology that adapts to us</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Technical Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      The site itself embodies these principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimal complexity</strong>: Nothing between you and the ideas</li>
      <li><strong>Semantic first</strong>: Meaning encoded in structure, not styling</li>
      <li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong>: Works for everyone, enhances for many</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent process</strong>: The building becomes part of the content</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Connect</h2>
    <p>
      This is an ongoing exploration. If these ideas resonate, I'd love to hear your thoughts 
      on how AI is changing your relationship with computing.
