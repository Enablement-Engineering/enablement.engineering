# enablement.engineering

A minimal blog exploring how AI serves as the translation layer between human intention and computational capabilities.

## Philosophy

This project embodies the belief that AI represents the first technology capable of adapting computing to humans, rather than forcing humans to adapt to computing. It explores how Large Language Models can act as semantic translators, bridging the gap between what people want to accomplish and what computers can do.

### Core Principles

1. **Human-First Computing**: Technology should mold to human needs and intentions
2. **Semantic Translation**: Converting human intention into computational action across modalities
3. **Accessibility as Foundation**: Universal design principles guide every decision
4. **Minimal Complexity**: Only include what serves the human experience

## Technical Foundation

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) - a content-first web framework that aligns with our philosophy:
- **Performance by Default**: Ships zero JavaScript unless needed
- **Content-Centric**: Native Markdown support with type-safe content collections
- **Accessible**: Encourages semantic HTML and progressive enhancement
- **Minimal**: No unnecessary complexity between intention and output

## Features

- 📝 Markdown-based content authoring
- 🌓 Light/dark mode with system preference detection
- ♿ WCAG AA compliant accessibility
- 🚀 Lightning-fast static generation
- 📱 Responsive, mobile-first design

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Content Structure

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/posts/`. Each post explores aspects of AI as an enablement technology, focusing on real-world applications and philosophical implications.

## Design Philosophy

The site design reflects the content philosophy:
- **Minimal**: Nothing between the reader and the ideas
- **Accessible**: Every human should be able to engage with the content
- **Semantic**: Proper HTML structure that conveys meaning
- **Adaptive**: Respects user preferences (color scheme, motion, contrast)
